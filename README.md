How to use the compiler?
==
Using any Linux Operating System based on Debian, you must open the terminal. Through cd command place on the Compiler folder and use the following command:

    $ ./arm-compiler inputfilepath outputfilepath

where inputfilepath is the source code where your code is written and "outputfilepath" is the output file path where you want to obtain the binaries.
